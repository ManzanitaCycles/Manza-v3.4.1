## The versatile adventure machine

There's no wrong way to set up a gravel bike. Whether you prefer a fat-tire road bike, a progressive drop bar mountain bike, or something in between, it all depends on the terrain you enjoy riding and your comfort with underbiking.

Your Manzanita gravel bike will be designed and built for you. The fit, geometry, and tubing selection will be tuned for your weight, riding style, and frame size.

And if you want to take it bikepacking, you can request mounts for a custom, bolt-on frame bag, extra water bottles, and a rear rack.

Starting at **{{ pricing.baseFrame }}**

        <p>In the world of gravel bikes, nothing is standard. That's the beauty of it. If you want to run a 2x drivetrain with moderate-width tires, great. If you want to run a suspension fork, a 1x drivetrain, and mountain bike tires, you can do that too.</p>
        <p>We'll work together to make you the gravel bike that suits your needs.</p>

        <p>If you choose the Manzanita fork, the frame's head tube can be smaller since it doesn't have to fit a tapered steerer tube.</p>
        <p>Manzanita forks are only available with IS brake mounts. If you want to use flat mount brakes, consider going with a carbon fork instead.</p>
